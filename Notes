// Sensory Experiences = f(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5....) where
x1 = conditions of the body = g(y1, y2, y3, y4)
x2 = Attention of the self
x3 = condition of the object = h(z1, z2, z3, z4)
x4 = Preconditioning of the self
x5 = Intensity, quality and Duration of contact

Character of experiences 
-> Transient and fleeting
-> nature of addiction
-> Diminishing Marginal return 
-> hedonistic adaptation

// Evolution of philosophy of happiness in human
1) Sleeping/resting is happiness
2) Money is happiness
3) Legitimate money + Respect is happiness
4) Giving/Donating is happiness
5) Knowing is happiness


// Category of Aspirations/Desires
-> become something (By qualification or wealth)
-> do something (in/to the outside)
-> Acquire something (from the outside)
-> to do with our being( wellbeing within)

If we observe our desires/aspirations, we will observe that our desire will fall in one of the four categories

Category 1 -> become something
Each one of us has some aims, some big goals we want to fulfil or achieve. When we achieve or become what we had set out to, we feel a sense of accomplishment. This feeling of
accomplishment makes us feel contented, which we interpret as happiness.

Category 2 -> do something
Through all this ‘doing’, we aspire to have some ‘successful outcomes’ from our actions:- This can be anything ranging from appearing and succeeding in an examination, having a safe 
journey in travel, a successful business transaction, completing the puzzle, completing construction of a house, to winning a chosen sport competition. We feel good in realizing these 
'outcomes' for our outcomes. It feels nice when you are able to carry out some action the way ‘you had imagined it or thought of it’. Attaining such 'outcomes' or a ‘result’ that we 
value becomes a source of a feeling of peace, which we refer to as ‘happiness’.

Category 3 -> Acquire Something 
-> Acquiring materialistic things 
   -> variety of 'material things' like money, house, bikes, cars, computers, mobile phones etc.
   -> we also have aspirations of acquiring sensations from our five senses: things we can see, hear, touch, smell & taste. For ex: we enjoy tasty food and
     choose to eat things we like (like a samosa, a cake, a chocolate etc); we like such sensations, which we interpret as ‘happiness’.
-> Acquiring company of Good people 
-> Acquiring something to do with our goal -> When we have such goals, we keep seeking to acquire information or ways in which we can achieve our goal.

Category 4 -> to do with our being( wellbeing within)
we have a Category #4 of Aspirations/wants that is a hidden, silent, subtle expectation behind all our actions and aspirations: It is do with our ‘being’, the final experience of
everything we do – which is to be Happy, Peaceful, Contented & Joyous.

////We can see that what we do via the first 3 categories is get to the ultimate fruit in ‘category 4’.


What is happiness?
In psychology, happiness is a mental or emotional state of wellbeing which can be defined by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy.

Notice that we feel 'good' when we are able to accomplish what we seek - be it via becoming, doing or acquiring something. When we are unable to do so, or when the possibility of such 
success seems unlikely, we feel strained within. For ex: you want to be a Doctor, but cannot or it seems that you likely not. In each of these situations, we can notice that this gap 
between what we want and what happens/ or what seems likely will happen creates a discord, a conflict within us. We do not like being in this state, and we want to get out of it. We 
reject such situations within and seek ways and means to get out of them, or resolve them. This is unhappiness.
Conversely, whenever such successes are achieved, there is an absence of such discord in us and we feel comfortable or good.

So, Basically happiness is "To be in a state of non-conflict/harmony, or to live with a feeling of acceptance is happiness".

On the other hand, when we cannot not do the things we desired, when we cannot have what we want, when we experience feelings such as failure, disrespect, or when we lack of confidence, 
are doubtful in ourselves, etc. we find it unacceptable. We reject such states and do not wish for a continuation of these feelings within and want to try and change it.

So, basically unhappiness is "To be in a state of conflict/disharmony, or to live in a state of unacceptance is unhappiness".

// Prosperity 
-> Wealth is a quantifiable thing. It means, having money, or having a lot of material things, or both.
-> Prosperity: Prosperity is a feeling, an outcome of clarity or understanding. It is not a physical standard and hence not quantifiable. When we are able to have or produce more 
   material goods than is needed for our family, we live with this feeling of being prosperous.
  ‘feeling of having, producing more, or the ability to produce more material things than is required’.
  "The absence of the absence (of material goods)" - in other words, a feeling of abundance

Not only do we want wealth, but we also want to feel prosperous. In other words, our basic-desire is to feel prosperous, and wealth is a means to that end.

// In order to be prosperous, we need to do 2 things:
-> Correctly identify our material needs
-> Have/produce more than what is required.

We see that today, we are unable to do this- we are focused on accumulating wealth or materialthings, but it may not be accompanied by the feeling of being prosperous! This is because, 
we do not identify our material needs, and hence, no matter how much we have, it is always feels less, and we feel deprived.

Q1 -> Why do I live?
= My Basic-desire, aspiration, expectation, Goal
= Happiness* & Prosperity
